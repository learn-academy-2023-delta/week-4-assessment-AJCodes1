# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: object oriented programming is like a collection of objects that communicate with one another with reusable lines of code. Functional programming is just functions that perform a specific task.

Researched answer: functional programing uses immutable data to tell the progrma exactly what to do. object oriented programming tells the program how to achieve results through objects altering the progrmas state.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: an interger is a whole number and a float is a number with decimals.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. RSpec: is a testing tool for Ruby 

2. Test-driven development: is about innovating faster and reducing waste, it starts with writing a failing test case and then creating just enough code to pass the test.

3. PostgreSQL: it is a highly stable database management system, it is used as the primary data store or data warehouse for many web, mobile, geospatial, and analytics applications.

4. CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete. 4 essential operations for creating and managing persistent data elements, mainly in relational and NoSQL databases.

5. HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol, set of rules for transferring files such as text, images, sound, video and other mutimedia files.
